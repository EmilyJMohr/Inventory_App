<!--    1) create at least 3 unique resources (grab 3 pics of jewelry)
        
        2) create the following information fields *name, *price, and *"in stock"; 
        for jewelry also include sale price, type/color of materials*, length, width*, diameter, *stock number,
        Note: items marked with "*" should be required
        
        3) Each source needs a "remove" button incase item no longer sold
        
        4a) Create a form for the USER that includes all above fields, as well as an 
        image url upload field, a "Sumbit" button, and a "Reset" form button.
        4b) The "Sumbit" button adds each new resource to the top of the page 
        and auto-clears the form. Note forms auto-clear when a "submit" button is pressed
        but doesn't add items to the top of the page.
        4c) "Reset" button clears the form but doesn't submit the info
        5)
